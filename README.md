####  An indie team creating immersive worlds — one game at a time.


## Our Game 

Porject Cipher is a narrative-driven, action-packed first-person shooter immersive sim that blends retro spy-thriller aesthetics with deep gameplay choices and stealth mechanics. Set in an alternate Cold War timeline, players step into the shoes of Agent M, a resourceful and quick-witted espionage agent tasked with preventing the world from falling into the hands of a high-tech villainous organization.

Drawing heavy inspiration from No One Lives Forever and Deus Ex, Project Cipher combines freedom of playstyle, strategic gadgetry, and dynamic narrative choices that provide players with multiple paths to complete each mission—whether through diplomacy, stealth, or full-on action. The game will also feature an original, adaptive soundtrack, further enhancing the immersive, retro atmosphere.
